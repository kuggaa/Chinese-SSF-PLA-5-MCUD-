program appears to be aligned with the GAD Precision Guidance Experts Group, with Yao Yu for example serving
on both the 863-801 and Precision Guidance Expert Groups. Another expert, Long Teng [龙腾] from Beijing

229 The boost-glide concept was first developed by Eugene Sanger and other German aerospace engineers in the
1930s and refined by Dr. Qian Xuesen, the father of China’s space and missile program, while at the U.S. Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in 1951. In Sanger’s concept, a launch vehicle would propel itself to the upper
atmosphere then glide with no power until it hit denser air. It then would use kinetic energy to skip off the
atmosphere back up to higher altitudes, similar to a stone skipping along water. Each skip reduces the available
energy until it glides toward its target. Sanger calculated that a missile launched from Nazi Germany would
require three skips to strike a target in the eastern United States. The Russians reportedly flight tested a similar
boost-glide vehicle in 2005. The “skipping” also could involve energy management or “phugoid” porpoise-like
measures in which the missile pitches up and climbs then pitches down and descends.

Synthetic Aperture Radar” (合成孑L径雷达的主要发展方向),Modern Defense Technology, April 2007, pp. 81-88. The
authors are from the PLA’s Institute of Electronic Engineering in Hefei, Anhui province. Also see Qin Yuliang,
Wang Jiantao, Wang Hongqiang, and Li Xiang, “Overview of Missile-Borne Synthetic Aperture Radar”
(弹载合成孔径雷达技术研究综述), Signal Processing (xinhao chuli), April 2009, pp. 630-635. The authors are from the
National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), which hosts a National Laboratory for Precision Guidance
and Automated Target Recognition (精确制导自动目标识别国家重点实验室).

Electronic Engineering in Hefei.
237 In one Chinese analysis, the ASBM radar is viewed as sophisticated and costly as the AN/APG-77 active
electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. With the radar accounting for about half, the authors estimate that the
unit cost of an ASBM including the launcher would U.S. $5-10.5 million. See Qiu and Long, “A Discussion of
China’s Development of an Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile,” Modern Ships (Xiandai jianchuan), 2006 Issue 12(B); and
Qiu and Long, “930 Seconds – A Discussion on China’s Development of an Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile
(Operational Scenario),” Modern Ships, 2007 Issue 01(B).
238 While unclear at the present time, it appears that R&D on ground and air-launched variants of the DH-10 were
conducted in parallel. Both variants appear to have been tested in Summer and Fall 2003. The CASIC Third
Academy design team appears to have included Liu Yongcai [刘永才] as chief designer, Zheng Riheng [郑日恒] as
engine sub-system designer; Feng Dawei [冯大伟] as control sub-system designer; and Zou Zhiqin [邹志勤] as INS
sub-system designer.
