Countering Chinese Cyber Operations: Opportunities and Challenges for U.S. Interests|

Computer networks are the main arteries of cyber operations. Information and
communications technology enable and enhance the capabilities of actors to engage in
the cyber realm. Modern societies and governments increasingly rely on cyber-based
information systems in order to process, coordinate, and manage critical processes
necessary to function. Yet due to the highly automated and interconnected nature of
economic transactions and the protection of critical infrastructure, the cyber domain is
emerging as a new dimension in conflicts of the future. Therefore, the capability
inherent in the exploitation of computer network operations (CNO) represents a
significant evolutionary stage in both civil and military affairs. In the case of the People’s
Republic of China (China), driven by political insecurities and a quest for total
information awareness, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), state authorities, and the
Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are allegedly waging a coordinated CNO
campaign against a broad range of international targets.
Chinese cyber espionage poses an advanced persistent threat to U.S. national and
economic security. Groups operating from PRC territory are believed to be waging a
coordinated cyber espionage campaign targeting U.S. government, industrial, and think
tank computer networks. A dozen of these groups have been identified and linked with
the PLA, and others connected with universities and information security enterprises.1
The largest and most active of these groups may operate from Beijing and Shanghai.2
Few, if any, U.S. organizations that work on China issues have escaped
intrusions.3 Targets include U.S. government networks, defense industry, hightechnology and energy companies, think tanks and other nongovernmental
organizations, media outlets, and academic institutions. Characterized by methods of
encrypting exfiltrated data, attempts to gain control and access to U.S. computer
systems rely in large part upon socially engineered email messages that may seem
authentic targeting organizations and individuals of interest. Emails usually include an
attachment, image or hyperlink, which, when opened, installs a remote access tool
(RAT) that enables an operator to gain access and control of the recipient’s computer.
Operators may also use other techniques in which a computer of a targeted individual is
compromised after accessing an infected website.4
While there are many cases, attributing responsibility to a specific Chinese-entity
is a difficult task. However, the PLA General Staff Department (GSD) Third Department
is likely a leading authority for cyber surveillance. In the absence of officially verified
evidence, this informed hypothesis is based on an assessment of the department’s
2

|Countering Chinese Cyber Operations: Opportunities and Challenges for U.S. Interests|

traditional core competency in signals intelligence, its high performance computing and
encryption/decryption technical capabilities, and status as China’s largest employer of
well-trained linguists.5 Roughly analogous to the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA),
the Third Department manages one of the largest intelligence collection and
information security infrastructures in the world. Accepting as premise that the
capabilities of the Third Department may be an indicator of its possible mission: How
may the Third Department be organized and equipped to command and control a
coordinated CNO infrastructure? And from a U.S. standpoint: What means are available
to counter an integrated cyber espionage campaign?
This assessment posits that the GSD Third Department command authorities
manage a complex cyber reconnaissance infrastructure that exploits vulnerable
computer networks around the world, while also ensuring the integrity of classified
networks within China. Based on a thorough evaluation of available data, this
infrastructure may center upon the Third Department’s Beijing North Computing
Center (BNCC). While the command relationships between these known and other
unknown entities remain unclear, the PLA’s CNO infrastructure also relies on a handful
of Third Department managed information security bases that serve as a platform for
cooperation with academia and cybersecurity companies.
Operational Third
Department entities, such as the Third Department Second Bureau in Shanghai, also
appear to play a prominent role within a broader CNO network, alongside technical
reconnaissance bureaus (TRBs) under military regions.
This assessment concludes with a brief discussion of policies that could best
mitigate challenges posed by Chinese cyber espionage. Countering a coordinated cyber
reconnaissance campaign requires reducing the value of information through thoughtful
deception, enhanced counterintelligence, greater cooperation with international
partners such as Taiwan, and imposing costs through effective deterrence.

Background
The PRC government views informatization of Chinese society as a means to
ensure sustained economic growth, compete globally in the information technology
realm, and ensure national security.6 Informatization relies on information security
systems that can support economic restructuring and national security. In the
information age, information security can be viewed within the broadest context as
ensuring CCP legitimacy, enhancing the party-state’s ability to consolidate power,
defending national networks against internal and external threats, and supporting
economic development. Therefore, security of the party and state requires mastery of
the global cyber sphere.7
3

|Countering Chinese Cyber Operations: Opportunities and Challenges for U.S. Interests|

Party and state leaders oversee an expansive but fragmented cyber operations
policy infrastructure. The State Informatization Leading Group (SILG), consisting of
senior representatives of the CCP Central Committee Politburo, State Council, and PLA,
establishes national informatization policies.8 With cyber security an important facet of
informatization, the SILG’s Network and Information Security Working Group
[网络与信息安全组] has advised senior leaders on CNO policy.9
From a military perspective, Chinese PLA authors view cyber operations as a
basis of modern warfare. Chinese CNO often is placed in the context of information
security, or “network attack and defense,” based on the premise that “without
understanding how to attack, one will not know how to defend.”10 The GSD Third
Department manages China’s largest network for surveillance of foreign computercontrolled communications and computer networks themselves. The GSD Third
Department enjoys a traditional core competency in signals intelligence (SIGINT), high
performance computing, and encryption/decryption technical capabilities. The Third
Department also is China’s largest employer of well-trained linguists.
Cyber reconnaissance, or computer network exploitation (CNE) in the U.S.
lexicon, represents the cutting edge of SIGINT and there are indicators that point to the
Third Department serving as a national executive agent for CNE.11 The Third
Department has direct authority over 12 operational bureaus, a computing center, and
three research institutes.12 Bureau-level leaders have grades equivalent to that of an
Army division commander, and oversee between six and 14 subordinate sites or offices
[chu; 处]. The Third Department’s 12 operational bureaus mostly likely report to the
Headquarters Department. The operational bureaus are separate and distinct from
TRBs under the PLA’s seven Military Regions, and the three Services: Air Force, Navy,
and Second Artillery.13
On behalf of the State Council’s Ministry of Science and Technology, National
Crypto Management Center, State Secrecy Bureau, Ministry of Public Security, and
Ministry of State Security, the GSD Third Department also has administrative oversight
of at least three information security engineering bases located in Shanghai, Beijing, and
Tianjin.14
The Third Department’s National Information Security Engineering Technology
Center (NISEC) was established in Shanghai in 2001 and is directed by Senior Colonel
Wen Zhonghui [文仲慧]. Born in 1954, NISEC Director Senior Colonel Wen is a
cryptologic specialist who rose through the ranks of the GSD 58th Research Institute. He
sits on the 863 Program Information Security Expert Working Group (863-917
Program, which funded establishment of the Great Firewall of China security system),
and two information security standardization committees (WG-3 and WG-7).15
4

|Countering Chinese Cyber Operations: Opportunities and Challenges for U.S. Interests|

Established in 2005 and directed by Major General Yuan Jianjun [袁建军], the
engineering center’s Beijing base is known as the National Research Center for
Information Technology Security. Major General Yuan, director of the National
Research Center for Information Technology Security, was formerly head of the PLA
Information Security Evaluation and Certification Center (a Third Department Third
Bureau-affiliated entity).16
Central authorities approved the establishment of a third base in Tianjin in 2009,
which specializes in cryptographic keying material, systems integration, and computer
network attack technology.17 Collocated with these engineering centers are National
Information Security Industrial Bases [国家信息安全产业基地], with additional
industrial bases located in Wuhan and Chengdu.18
In addition to ensuring adherence to national information security
standardization guidelines and training a new generation of cyber operations specialists,
national information security bases appear to function as clusters that leverage
academic and entrepreneurial talents of host cities. For example, Sichuan University’s
Institute of Information Security supports the Chengdu information security base and
Shanghai Jiaotong University’s School of Information Security supports the Shanghai
base.
Within the Third Department, responsibilities for cyber reconnaissance remain
opaque. Successful reconnaissance depends on cryptologic skills, stealth, automated
scanning of targeted network vulnerabilities, data fusion and storage, and counterreconnaissance technology.19 While a number of PLA and other governmental entities
likely share CNO responsibilities, at least two GSD Third Department organizations may
be cognizant of groups responsible for cyber espionage. In particular, BNCC appears to
have the technological capacity to manage a coordinated cyber operations network. The
5

|Countering Chinese Cyber Operations: Opportunities and Challenges for U.S. Interests|

Third Department Second Bureau in Shanghai is a representative example of a group
possibly charged with collection and exploitation operations.
Beijing North Computing Center
Among PLA entities surveyed in this study, the
GSD Third Department BNCC appears most capable of
cyber reconnaissance architecture design, technology
development, systems engineering, and acquisition.
BNCC is located adjacent to Beijing University and the
Central Party School in the city’s northwestern
Jiaoziying [哨子营] suburb. At least 10 subordinate
divisions appear responsible for design and
development of computer network defense, attack, and
exploitation systems.
One of China’s earliest
organizations engaged in high performance computing,
BNCC leaders are equivalent in grade to an army
division commander or Third Department bureau
director.
BNCC, which is also referred to as the GSD 418th Research Institute, has a
military cover designation of the 61539 Unit (previously was the 57370 Unit). BNCC
may also be known as the Beijing North Commercial College [北京北方商业学院].20
Senior BNCC authorities include Senior Colonel Geng Xiaohe [耿孝和] and Jia Yinghe
[贾颖禾], and former BNCC Director Zhu Zhaoming [朱兆明] remains active in cyber
community. Geng Xiaohe and Jia Yinghe both have served as senior advisors to the
State Council Informatization Office’s Information Security
Working Group, and are also committee members of
national-level computing associations. BNCC Chief of Staff
and division directors include Fu Shengxin, [伏圣信], Li
Xiaohui [李晓惠], Yao Jingsong [姚京松], Kong Tiesheng
[孔铁生], Ma Hang [马航], and Yang Baoming [杨宝明].21
Specific BNCC responsibilities are shrouded by a
thick veil of secrecy. Initial indications of a role in cyber
operations emerged in 2000, when Falungong authorities
accused BNCC of launching denial-of-service attacks
against the organization’s mail servers.22
Facility
construction projects underway since 2006 indicate a
significant growth in its scope of operations.23 China’s
6

|Countering Chinese Cyber Operations: Opportunities and Challenges for U.S. Interests|

leading cybersecurity experts, including BNCC Deputy Director Jia Yinghe, have
highlighted the need for active defense involving intrusions of and attacks against
enemy systems.24 BNCC likely plays a leading role in command and control network
management, code breaking, advanced malware development and acquisition, data
storage, and vulnerability assessment. BNCC officers have experience in computer
network attack and defense [网络攻防], network intrusion monitoring and control, and
information collection. BNCC software source code has been made available to
enterprises for commercialization. In addition to developing one of China’s first stealthy
RATs, BNCC fielded China’s most advanced network intrusion detection system for
analyzing threats and assessing vulnerabilities, including those associated with
operating systems such as Android.25 BNCC’s active defense software was certified in
tests involving attacks against target networks.26 Its risk assessment function includes
analysis of command and control systems. Supercomputing is required to crack
advanced encryption systems. BNCC’s advanced computing networks servers appear
sufficient to handle vast databases containing collected electronic communications and
files, including recorded phone calls, radio chatter, private emails, internet search
records, passwords, password-protected computer files, as well as an abundance of
personal data on individuals of interest.
BNCC maintains a close relationship with a number of organizations within
China’s broader CNO community. In addition to formal positions within China’s
parallel and high performance computing community, BNCC senior engineers serve as
advisors to the State Council Informatization Office, specifically the Information
Security Working Group.
Basic and developmental research support on high
performance computing is carried out by the Third Department 56th Research Institute
in Wuxi and National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) in Changsha. BNCC
divisions rely on at least a dozen cybersecurity companies for day to day work. BNCCaffiliated companies also support information security engineering bases in Beijing,
Shanghai, and Tianjin.27
GSD Third Department Second Bureau
While BNCC appears to be a central CNO authority, other GSD Third Department
entities may manage routine exploitation of vulnerabilities in U.S. computer networks.
The GSD Third Department Second Bureau is an illustrative example.28 Responsible for
collection operations against U.S. communications and computer networks, most
Second Bureau elements are situated in Shanghai City. The Second Bureau command
compound is located in Shanghai’s northeastern Gaoqiao district. The First Division is
collocated with Second Bureau headquarters, and appears responsible for analysis.
Four of the eight identified divisions under the Second Bureau are located in Shanghai’s
northern Baoshan District. At least two of these divisions appear to operate from a
7

|Countering Chinese Cyber Operations: Opportunities and Challenges for U.S. Interests|

Third Department Second Bureau satellite ground station in Baoshan District’s
Caijiaying village. Other elements probably under command of the Second Bureau are
located in Sichuan Province and on Hainan Island.29

The Second Bureau maintains relationships with a range of entities in the greater
Shanghai area. The Second Bureau leverages access to the Shanghai City’s internet
monitoring center (dubbed the Shanghai 005 Center), which is managed by China
Telecom.30 It maintains facilities in the vicinity of submarine cable landing stations on
Chongming Island and in Shanghai’s southern Nanhui District.31 Senior officers, both
retired and active, maintain academic affiliations with the Shanghai Association of
International Strategic Studies and the Shanghai Strategy Association.32 The Second
Bureau managed the establishment of the Third Department’s information security
engineering base in Shanghai.33 Based on the number of technical studies jointly
produced by representatives from both organizations, the Second Bureau also enjoys a
cooperative working relationship with Shanghai Jiaotong University’s School of
Information Security Engineering.34
Other Third Department elements in the Shanghai area include the Third
Department 12th Bureau command (61486 Unit); and the Third Bureau’s Third Division
(61587 Unit). As a side note, members of the Third Department Third Bureau’s Third
Division have conducted studies on cyber warfare, including analysis of weaknesses in
Android operating systems and NTLM authentication protocols. Members of the Third
Division have carried out joint studies with Shanghai Jiaotong University’s Department
of Computer Science and Engineering.35

In short, the GSD Third Department command authorities manage a complex
infrastructure that exploits vulnerable computer networks around the world.
Responsible for ensuring PLA freedom of action in cyberspace, BNCC appears to play a
central role in coordinating cyber reconnaissance operations among a range of players,
software engineering, and data storage. In addition to the Third Department’s Second
Bureau in Shanghai, other PLA organizations are also positioned to exploit foreign
computer networks.
While appearing to exercise executive authority, the GSD Third Department does
not enjoy a monopoly over cyber espionage. TRBs subordinate to military regions, the
Air Force, Navy, and Second Artillery also may collect against foreign targets of interest.
For example, one source with a record of reliable reporting on cyber issues has
highlighted operations traced back to the Shenyang Military Region TRB. Public
security bureaus at city and provincial levels also have computer monitoring groups, as
does the Ministry of State Security. The Third Department First Bureau (61786 Unit)
manages an information security research center [信息安全研究中心] that is most likely
focused on cryptography, and the Seventh Bureau has published a number of studies on
cyber operations. The Third Department Third Bureau oversees several cyber security
functions, such as certification of public keying material.36

Concluding Comments
Cyber espionage and potential disruption of critical U.S. computer networks have
emerged as a significant national security challenge. In his May 2011 International
Strategy for Cyberspace, President Obama declared that the United States will work
with partners to “encourage responsible behavior and oppose those who would seek to
disrupt networks and systems, dissuading and deterring malicious actors, and reserving
the right to defend these vital national assets as necessary and appropriate.” In
response, the U.S. national security community is adopting a multifaceted approach to
address the cybersecurity challenge, including through strengthened awareness,
deterrence, greater investment into counterintelligence, and international partnerships.
Defenses require a combination of measures. Counterintelligence tools include both
disruption and deception, which offset the inherent asymmetric advantages that the
attacking side enjoys.37
Deception as Defense
Passive or defensive network operations alone are inadequate to defend sensitive
data. Offensive operations are core to counter-cyber espionage doctrine.38 An initial
approach to defending against Chinese cyber surveillance is deception and perception
management.39 Viewing cybersecurity as a major national security problem, the White
9

|Countering Chinese Cyber Operations: Opportunities and Challenges for U.S. Interests|

House established the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) that
includes a government-wide cyber counterintelligence plan and developing enduring
deterrence strategies and programs.40 Programs also involve forensic examination of
networks to identify, disrupt, neutralize, penetrate, or exploit Chinese cyber
reconnaissance activities. With the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as lead for
cyber counterintelligence operations, a key aspect of the CNCI includes proactive
disruption of Chinese exploitation of U.S. computer networks.41 Presumably as part of
the CNCI, U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) has implemented a cyber deception
program, with care taken to avoid “blowback” that affects U.S. society.42 Deception and
disinformation has also been recommended as a defensive tool for U.S. corporations and
non-profit enterprises.43
Cyber deception likely would be effective due to PLA tendency for stovepiping
and an ingrained cognitive bias regarding the United States and its intentions.
Deception as a defense complicates an attacker’s ability to plan and execute
operations.44 Necessary tools allow cyber intruders to retrieve material that is
manipulated before release. Honeypots, or the creation of false networks, are one form
of deception.45 However, more sophisticated forms of data manipulation creates
challenges for PLA collectors and analysts, and increases workload with minimal
investment of resources for the U.S. side. The Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA) has invested in research and development on “fog
computing,”46 a scalable and automated architecture for detecting intruders and offering
decoy products rather than legitimate information.47 DARPA also is investing in a next
generation national cyber range to be managed by Johns Hopkins Applied Physics
Laboratory.48 As a final note, cyber defenses could benefit from greater investment into
traditional human intelligence work and open source exploitation. Individuals with
direct access to party-state information security policies and GSD Third Department
cyber reconnaissance activities may provide valuable support for technical operations.49
International Cyber Code of Conduct
Another approach to cyber-defense is engaging PRC civilian and military
authorities on the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, an initiative
that Chinese and Russian representatives proposed in September 2011.50 While Chinese
expression of interest in an international code of conduct is a positive move, the
proposal fails to strengthen international cross-border law enforcement. Article 3 only
supports international collaboration in the case of a threat to its power base by dissident
political extremists or terrorists. The proposed code promotes national censorship
policies, while at the same time promoting the freedom to search, acquire, and
disseminate information. Furthermore, the proposed code of conduct makes no
reference to cyber espionage.51 While challenges exist in developing a common set of
10

|Countering Chinese Cyber Operations: Opportunities and Challenges for U.S. Interests|

interests, most important would be a focus on managing non-state actors engaged in
cyber-related criminal activities. Worth noting is Beijing’s claim that non-state actors
are responsible for cyber reconnaissance activities launched from Chinese territory.52
An Asian Cyber Defense Alliance?
While developing an international code of conduct presents challenges, greater
collaboration with allies and coalition partners in the Asia-Pacific region may be
warranted. The Republic of China (Taiwan) is the most obvious candidate for codevelopment of techniques best suited for the challenges emanating from the PRC.53
Taiwan was the first and most intense target of CCP-sponsored cyber espionage.54 For
instance, in spite of the thaw in tensions between China and Taiwan over the past four
years, Taiwan’s intelligence chief – National Security Bureau director Tsai Der-sheng
[蔡得胜] – recently revealed at a legislative hearing that Chinese hackers have been
launching attacks on Taiwan-based websites, exfiltrating more than 26,000 pieces of
information over the past seven years. Moreover, the NSB has been the target of more
than 1 million cyber-attacks in the first half of this year alone.55
According to Chuang Ming-hsiung, section chief at the Taiwan Criminal
Investigation Bureau’s High-Technology Crime Prevention Center: “Before China
releases a virus to the United States, it will test it on Taiwan. That’s why Taiwan has a
faster response rate than the United States.”56 Furthermore, cyber defenders on Taiwan
are assisted by a shared cultural heritage with China, helping them to better decipher a
Chinese attacker’s strategic culture and way of thinking.57 The October 2007 agreement
on information technology signed by senior representatives of Taiwan MND and US
DoD is a solid foundation upon which to deepen and broaden the bilateral relationship
and beyond.58 As part of Taiwan’s own efforts to strengthen its cyber-defense
capabilities against China, the Taiwanese government is reportedly increasing its
spending on cyber-defenses by expanding the Communication Electronics and
Information Bureau (CEIB) and creating a facility for conducting simulated
cyberwarfare.59
Forceful Response?
The PLA’s ambitious cyber operations also warrant consideration of appropriate
responses to hostile attacks intended to neutralize U.S. command and control and
critical infrastructure. Most important would be the determination of what types of
computer network attacks would constitute an act of war, and whether or not kinetic
responses would be appropriate. As National Security Agency Director and CYBERCOM
Commander General Keith Alexander noted in a recent Congressional testimony: “I can
assure you that, in appropriate circumstances and on order from the National Command
11

|Countering Chinese Cyber Operations: Opportunities and Challenges for U.S. Interests|

Authority, we can back up the department’s assertion that any actor threatening a
crippling cyber attack against the United States would be taking a grave risk.”60
Cyberspace is a critical domain for national security and computer network
operations are essential tools for ensuring future operational effectiveness.
Governments throughout the world are taking active steps to strengthen cybersecurity.
In the case of the PRC, the existing data suggests that BNCC may be the leading agent
responsible for planning, coordinating, integrating, and synchronizing PLA computer
network operations, including defense of classified networks, exploitation of foreign
networks, and possibly denying an adversary access to his networks. Roughly analogous
to the U.S. CYBERCOM, BNCC ensures PLA freedom of action in cyberspace.
Information security engineering bases in Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin serve as
windows to the broader academic and commercial cybersecurity community. The Third
Department Second Bureau is an illustrative example of a front end collection entity
that may exploit the network managed by BNCC and information security bases.
In order to mitigate the challenges posed by Chinese cyber espionage and
countering a coordinated cyber reconnaissance campaign require reducing the value of
information through thoughtful deception, enhanced counterintelligence, greater
cooperation with international partners such as Taiwan, and imposing costs through
effective deterrence. The U.S. appears to be taking the Chinese cyber challenge seriously
and dedicating resources into countermeasures. As noted above, deception and
technological defenses are two viable investments that could be augmented with an
expanded dialogue on a cyber code of conduct. Greater consideration of appropriate
and measured deterrent options and potential forceful responses are warranted as well.

Systems developed and fielded by BNCC are licensed by or compete with private enterprises, such as
Venus Technologies. Among various sources, see
http://product.it168.com/ProductCompare_p199458_101684_s0515.shtml. The NETMAN covert
remote access software was awarded a PLA technology award in 1999. See Zhu Chunyan, “Helping to
Control Own Networks: Beijing North Computing Center Produces NETMAN Network Management
System” [帮助你管好自己的网络 北方计算中心推出网络管理系统 NetMan], Computer World Journal,
1995 (Issue 47). NETMAN, which was certified in 1995, has become a common remote access tool that is
advertised as capable of stealthy network penetration. BNCC also was responsible for SAFEmate
[网络安全伴侣], a network attack and defense project sponsored by the State Council Informatization
Office and certified in 1997. BNCC also co-developed the NISDetector network monitoring and early
warning system, ISExplorer intrusion detection system, and the DSC-200 software package that cleans
electronic fingerprints. In addition to developing NetGet information collection software (see

The Third Department Second Bureau was formerly the 57322 Unit. Former Second Bureau leader Lu
Peng [吕蓬] now serves as Deputy Director of the Shanghai Institute for International Strategic Studies.
Former Second Bureau Political Commissar Qiu Zuping [邱祖平] appears to have been transferred to the
PLA Air Defense Command Academy in the 2010/2011 timeframe.

These landing sites are high volume entry points for internet traffic to and from China. The Chongming
facility may be subordinate to the 61161 Unit (possibly the Second Bureau’s Third Office). As a side note,
a GSD Fourth Department brigade (61251 Unit) oversees an element in the Nichangzhen area, and
possibly on Chongming Island.

The former is not to be confused with its affiliate, the Shanghai Institute of International Strategic
Studies [SIIS; 上海国际问题研究院]. Zhou Jianping is a senior officer from the Second Bureau’s First
Office who has an affiliation the Shanghai Association of International Strategic Studies [SAISS;
上海国际战略问题研究会] and the Shanghai Strategy Association [上海战略研究会]. Former Second Bureau
leader Lu Peng [吕蓬] serves as SAISS Deputy Director.

A construction company listed the Second Bureau as the contracting organization for construction of
the Engineering Center’s six-story building in Pudong. The same company also won the bid for
construction of the Second Bureau’s new general headquarters building in 2007. See “Notice of Unit and
Project Management” [报名单位及项目经理信息], Changzhou Project Bidding Center Website, at

A senior State Council Informatization Advisory Committee [国家信息化专家咨询委员会] member, He
Dequan [何德全], directs the Jiaotong University School of Information Security Engineering. The school
is collocated with the Third Department’s National Information Security Engineering Technology
Research Center. See “School of Information Security Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University,”
School of Information Security Engineering website, at
http://infosec.sjtu.edu.cn/infosec/en/introduction/intro1.html. For an example of joint research, see

presence in Ningbo City. As of 2011, Jin Ying [金鹰] commanded the Third Bureau Third Division (61587
Unit). He likely replaced Shi Yuanjie [石元杰]. Senior Colonel Zhang Fangxin [张方新] has been Political
Commissar since at least 2008. Deputy Commander Li Genquan [李根权] previously commanded a Third
Department Third Bureau collection site in Hangzhou (61791 Unit). Another Deputy Commander is Shi
Tongnian [施彤年].

The PLA Secrecy Committee Technical Security Research Institute [解放军保密委员会技术安全研究所]
is the 61600 Unit, which is most likely Third Department.
