Abstract-LIWC Traditional Chinese Simplified Chinese microblog text analysis
The words that people use could reveal their emotional states, intentions, thinking styles, individual differences, etc. LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) has been widely used for psychological text analysis, and its dictionary is the core. The Traditional Chinese version of LIWC dictionary has been released, which is a translation of LIWC English dictionary. However, Simplified Chinese which is the worldâ€™s most widely used language has subtle differences with Traditional Chinese. Furthermore, both English LIWC dictionary and Traditional Chinese version dictionary were both developed for relatively formal text. Microblog has become more and more popular in China nowadays. Original LIWC dictionaries take less consideration on microblog popular words, which makes it less applicable for text analysis on microblog. In this study, a Simplified Chinese LIWC dictionary is established according to LIWC categories. After translating Traditional Chinese dictionary into Simplified Chinese, five thousand words most frequently used in microblog are added into the dictionary. Four graduate students of psychology rated whether each word belonged in a category. The reliability and validity of Simplified Chinese LIWC dictionary were tested by these four judges. This new dictionary could contribute to all the text analysis on microblog in future.
ENGLISH/AMERICAN
LIWC Dictionary (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count)

The LIWC dictionary used in this demonstration is composed of 5,690 words and word stems. Each word or word stem defines one or more word categories. For example, the word 'cried' is part of four word categories: sadness, negative emotion, overall affect, and a past tense verb. Hence, if it is found in the target text, each of these four category scale scores will be incremented. As in this example, many of the LIWC categories are arranged hierarchically. All anger words, by definition, will be categorized as negative emotion and overall emotion words.

Each of the 69 preset LIWC categories used in this demo is composed of a list of dictionary words that define that scale. The table below provides a comprehensive list of these LIWC categories with sample scale words.
