6  Executive Summary Political Estimate The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) runs China authoritative leadership - chosen by the CCP The CCP uses it’s political influences to control – Military – Business – Opposing political views – Information and Education To advance within China, CCP membership is seen as a necessity. New technological advances are beginning to show signs of influence in government 

7  Executive Summary Military Estimate Military controlled by the CCP – Ministry of Defense is a front – Central Military Commission used to command PLA Vast expansion of military budget Modern tactics and technology expansion in recent years Continued growth based on large number of citizens Division of branches based on need – Air force, Navy, Ground Forces, Artillery Military includes People’s Armed Police and Reserve Forces 

8  Executive Summary Economic Estimate Continual SOE focus will drive currency devaluation causing negative impact on private venture capital Slowing economic growth and on pace to become world’s top economy; no shift from SOE mainstream apparent Extensive borrowing by local governments and non performance indicates potential for growth in unemployment; labor unrest likely to increase Labor costs are likely to diminish after economic peak compounded by massive population Private consumption at all time low and little disposable income; lack of social safety net drives consumer saving Expanded economic growth perceivable, more FDI and elevated rate of trade dependence Overdependence on exports and fixed investing, pollution and environmental exhaustion, social disadvantages and worsening conditions for lower class Governing perspective on Military prowess neglectful of economic devotion 

9  Executive Summary Cyber Estimate Concentrated effort to excel on Information war fronts Massive espionage undertaking Offensive onslaught of hacking directed toward corporate and government entities Loss of information on an exceptional level from many jurisdictions Specialized units for cyber offense and defense Top tier cyberwarfare power achievable Personnel to execute attacks on monumental level Huge expenditure and possible burden to economy for cyber agenda Mandatory direction required for computer and technology students New technology and potential ahead of adversaries Next generation of well trained professional leaders in cyber Potential global leaders in hardware and software Leaders in New Domain/ Lead superpower Social disassociation from Communism Public Unrest Government forced into green technology and better human rights Require global participation to maintain agenda 

10  Chinese Politics Source: http://blogs.voanews.com/photos/2012/01/11/ 

11  ~Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping “No organization or individual has the special right to overstep the Constitution and law, and any violation of the Constitution and the law must be investigated.” 

12  Only Communist Party-led state in the G-20 grouping of major economies China’s Communist Party dominates state and society China’s leading political institutions – Communist Party/Military – People’s Liberation Army – The State (State Council) – The National People’s Congress (NPC) POLITICAL/DIPLOMATIC 

13  Legislature – Controlled by Communist Party – Led by seven Politburo Standing Committee members – Military is NOT considered an army, but a part of the Communist Party – Communist Party has 8 “minor” political parties POLITICAL/DIPLOMATIC 

14  There are eight other minor political parties – used to argue a “multi-party cooperation system” – combined members is fewer than 1 million – CCP caps yearly new members Required to accept the permanent leadership of the Communist Party Expected to work “hand in hand” with the Communist Party – develop socialism with Chinese characteristics – barred from operating as opposition parties POLITICAL/DIPLOMATIC 

15  Party Policy – Mandates that all Chinese people are bound by Constitution and Communist Law – Eliminates and rejects: Multi-party systems Separation of powers Bicameral legislature Federal system POLITICAL/DIPLOMATIC 

16  Chinese Communist Party (CCP) – 63 years of power in China – Now called the People’s Republic of China (PRC) – It is the leadership system of the party and state POLITICS/DIPLOMATIC

53  Chinese Economy Source: http://inphobe.blogspot.com/2009_07_01_archive.html Source: http://warnewsupdates.blogspot.com/2011/11/is-chinas-economy-going- bust.html

54  History of Chinese Economy Facts 1911 Revolution – 1937 Sino-Japanese War steep industrial growth/cotton- wheat demand/transportation grows rural marketing/experiments in farm lending/increased wages for skilled trades and farm workers/results in increased productivity People’s Republic of China government established/onset of rapid inflation/budget deficit/little retention of bank deposits or currency/future plans ascertained through USSR alliance/no trust in private enterprise or international market by governing power 

55  PRC Economic Future Plan Facts Resources industries concentrated/ increased domestic capacity/expanded industrial investment Soviet model “machines to produce machines” -key goal Industrial pursuit expense to rural policy- expendable Plan requirements Exponential expansion of: – Steel – Electricity – Mining – Machine-building – Education – Research 

56  Mao Zedong’s Lead Facts 1958 Policy Shift “Great Leap Forward” Collectivization – Farmland, tools, livestock, and rural labor absorbed into “People’s Communes” – Intent/raised production/grain and steel Huge negative impact – Disrupted admin routines – Work incentive ruined – Triggered man-made famine/ 30 million lives lost USSR pull-out/projects crippled 1966 Cultural Revolution Many schools and colleges were closed Remaining schools abandoned normal standards for up to ten years Accomplishments Economic growth Industrialization Technology Nuclear weapons Space exploration Human development- reduced infant mortality increased literacy disease control 

57  PRC Business Cycle Economic Reform Household farming popular Four Special Economic Zones on southern coast opened a portion of Chinese economy to international trade and investment Regional government owned business retained small share of profits to build state assets Retained profits revived some markets for industrial products Reform Impacts Resulted in massive increase in agricultural output Raised farm incomes, improved quality of life, and increased rural productivity Food exports increased and import decreased – Grain – Cotton – Sugar – Fruit Launched explosive boom in rural industry 

58  China’s 12 th Five Year Plan (2011-2015) The 12 th FYP (2011-2015) contains three broad themes or areas of focus – Economic restructuring – Promoting greater social equality – Protecting the environment Chinese industrial policy comes into play primarily in economic restructuring but also is apparent in the other areas of focus. Particularly noteworthy is the targeting of seven strategic emerging industries that are intended to become the backbone of China’s economy in the future and to be able to compete well on a global scale. Seven industries – Biotechnology – New energy – High-end equipment manufacturing – Energy conservation and environmental protection – Clean-energy vehicles – New materials – Next-generation information technology 

59  China’s 12 th Five Year Plan (2011-2015) The government reportedly intends to spend up to $2.1 trillion on these industries during the 12 Th FYP. Some of the highlights of the FYP include: achieving an average real GDP growth rate of 7% and ensuring that incomes rise at least as fast as GDP Consolidating inefficient sectors and promoting the services industry (with the goal of expanding service sector output to account for 47% of GDP—up four percentage points from the current level) Promoting energy saving and new energy industries; promoting the development of nuclear, water, wind, and solar power; and expanding non-fossil fuel to account for 11.4% of primary energy consumption Welcoming foreign investment in modern agriculture, high-technology, and environmental protection industries Turning coastal regions from “world’s factory” to hubs of research and development, high-end manufacturing, and services Lengthening high-speed railway and highway networks Increasing expenditure on R&D to account for 2.2% of GDP Expanding non-fossil fuel or refining to account for 11.4% of primary energy consumption Cutting water consumption per unit of value- added industrial output by 30%, energy consumption per unit of GDP by 16%, and carbon dioxide emission per unit of GDP by 17% Increasing the minimum wage by no less than 13% on average each year Building 36 million affordable apartments for low-income people 

60  Measuring an Economy Many economists contend that using nominal exchange rates to convert Chinese data into U.S. dollars fails to reflect the true size of China’s economy and living standards relative to the U.S. To combat this, estimates of exchange rates based on their actual purchasing power relative to the dollar are developed in order to make more accurate comparisons of economic data across countries, usually referred to as purchasing power parity (PPP) Using this method, the PPP exchange rate increases the estimated measurement of China’s economy and its per capita GDP 

61  Current and Projected Economic Growth Economists predict that on a PPP basis China will overtake the U.S. as the world’s largest economy by 2017 Further predictions put China’s economy at 24.1% larger than that of the United States by 2030 Source: http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33534.pdf 

62  China at a Glance Population – 1,344,130,000 GDP - $7,318,499,269,769 GDP growth– 9.2% Inflation 5.4% 

63  Applying the PPP to China’s Economy China’s GDP in 2012 was $8.2 Trillion – about two-thirds the size of the U.S. economy The per capita GDP of China was $6,190 – 12% that of the U.S. Applying the PPP raises China’s 2012 GDP from $8.2 Trillion to 12.6 Trillion This calculation indicates that China’s economy is 80% the size of that of the U.S. China’s share of the global GDP on a PPP basis rose from 3.7% in 1990 to 15% in 2012 The PPP measurement also raises China’s 2012 per capita GDP from $6,190 to $9,460 which is 18.9% of the U.S. level 

64  China’s Current World Economic Influence Second largest economy Largest merchandise exporter Second largest merchandise importer Second largest destination of foreign direct investment (FDI) Largest manufacturer Largest holder of foreign exchange reserves Largest creditor nation

67  Income Distribution In spite of increases in wages and disposable income, frustrations are growing that many citizens are not benefiting from China’s rapid growth. “A 2005 United Nations report stated that the income gap between the urban an rural areas was among the highest in the world and warned that this gap threatens social stability… The report urged China to take greater steps to improve conditions for the rural poor, and bolster education, health care, and the social safety net” Chinese Disposable Income as a Percent of GDP: 2000-2012 Source: China’s Economic Rise: History, Trends, Challenges, and Implications for the United States (March 4, 2013) http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33534.pdf 

68  China’s World Trade “In 2012, China overtook the United States as the world’s largest trading economy… Merchandise trade surpluses, large scale foreign investment, and large purchases of currencies to maintain its exchange rate with the dollar and other currencies have enabled China to become the world’s largest holder of foreign exchange reserves at $3.31 trillion at the end of 2012” Source: China’s Economic Rise: History, Trends, Challenges, and Implications for the United States (March 4, 2013) http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33534.pdf Impact of Globalization 

69  Impacts of Technological Change to Economy Rare element monopoly Necessity to refine economic policy Long term challenges Industry Banking system Undervalued currency 

70  China’s Monopoly of Rare Earth Elements (REE) “Rare earth elements (REE) are essential to civilian and military technologies and to the 21 st century global economy, including development of green technologies and advanced defense systems” China has a monopoly over 95% of mined production and refining July 2010 export cut imposed by China drove prices to a peak in mid-2011 “As of December 2012, REE prices had receded but still remained at least 80%, and as much as 600 % (depending on the type of REE) above pre-July 2010 levels” 

71  Devotion to Defense Contributions to defense match GDP Aging demographic and urbanization will repurpose funds for health care, pensions, public infrastructure, and environment Even in global economic downturn defense spending saw no decrease 

72  Long-Term Challenges: Industry Incomplete transition to a market economy and persisting government identification as a “socialist market economy” State owned business continue to dominate petroleum and mining, telecommunications, utilities, transportation, and other industrial sectors State owned businesses are shielded from competition, are the main sectors encouraged to invest overseas, and dominate the Chinese stock indexes “Of the 58 Chinese firms on the 2011 Fortune Global 500 list, 54 were identified as having government ownership of 50% or more” “The World Bank estimates that more than one in four SOE’s lose money” 

73  Long-Term Challenges: China’s Banking System Banking system and credit controlled by central government Credit is extended to government favored industries who receive preferential treatment and rates Private entities pay higher rates or obtain credit elsewhere Government set depositor interest rates are often below the rate of inflation which lowers household income State owned business loans are often not repaid leaving large numbers of non-performing loans Local governments believed to have borrowed extensively from state banks at the onset of the global economic slowdown which may increase non performing loans 

74  Long-Term Challenges: Undervalued Currency Government imposed exchange rates prevent currency values from floating beyond prescribed margins Results in large-scale purchases of money to preserve the exchange rate Undervaluing of Chinese currency makes exports less expensive and imports more expensive Policies have limited growth of the private sector and distorted markets by artificially lowering costs of capital, water, land, and energy below market levels 

75  Economic Judgments Slowing Chinese economy/neglectful of funds flowing to defense spending Continued favoritism for preferred industries will slow growth of market economy Private ventures continue to struggle/Chinese government concentrated on SOE’s Non-performing loans by state owned entities will continue to draw state bank funds down Dependence on exports and fixed investing debilitating for future of economy Internal currency value manipulation is dependent on viability of purchased monetary values – significant change in foreign currency rates draw Chinese currency value and availability down Chinese political structure will carry on with improper reporting of currency valuation

80  GSD 3 rd Department Personnel Training Generally, personnel are trained in two locations. Language based training is performed at the PLA University of Foreign Languages. After graduating, personnel are assigned to a bureau for mission specific technical training. Training for technical personnel, which includes electrical engineers, communications specialists, computer scientists, and network security specialists are sent to the PLA Information Engineering University. 

81  PLA GSD 3 rd Department 2 nd Bureau (Unit 61398) Unit 61398’s central building is a 12 story 130k sq ft building built in 2007 China Telecom provided special fiber optic infrastructure citing “national defense” Unit 61398 requires personnel trained in computer security and networking Also requires English language proficiency 

82  Cyber Espionage Tasking Chinese Communist Party(CCP) is tasking the PLA to commit cyber espionage worldwide Unit 61398 tasked with computer network operations Unit 61398 appears to be the primary group for targeting political, economic and military- related intelligence in the U.S. and Canada

85  Cyber Espionage Groups More than 20 such groups operating from China Studied since 2006, APT1 has been one of the most prolific in terms of quantity of data stolen APT1 is probably Unit 61398 

86  APT1 and Unit 61398 Similar Characteristics Source: http://intelreport.mandiant.com/ 

87  Characteristics (cont) Source: http://intelreport.mandiant.com/ 

88  APT1 – Level of Effort First detected late 2006, still active Has targeted at least 141 organizations Demonstrated capability to attack dozens simultaneously Maintains access to compromised systems – Average 356 days – Longest observed over 4 years 10 months 

89  APT1 – Local and Global Footprint Maintains an extensive worldwide infrastructure – Thousands of systems – Dozens of countries – Hundreds of domain names All attacks originate from four large networks in Shanghai – Two in Pudong New Area, home of Unit 61398 

90  APT1 Servers Source: http://intelreport.mandiant.com/ 

91  Operating Inside APT 1 APT1 Operators Typically use remote desktop from a Shanghai IP address to access hop points on compromised systems to disguise attack origin Typically use a “Chinese (Simplified) – US Keyboard” setting Indicates a client language setting of simplified Chinese (zh-cn), used predominately in China Taiwan and Hong Kong still use traditional Chinese (zh-tw) Three APT1 Operator Profiles “isn’t it ironic” With the level of monitoring and control conducted by China over Internet use it is necessary for the individuals conducting these operations to have less restricted access. This also means that these operators are likely to use this access for personal as well as professional activities. Consequently, they are also likely to expose themselves. Here are three examples: Ugly Gorilla DOTA SuperHard 

92  APT1 - Targets Of 141 observed attacks, HQ for 122 of victims were in English speaking countries – Includes 115 U.S., 5 U.K. and 2 Canada – 17 of the remaining 19 targets use English as a primary language for operations 

93  Source: http://intelreport.mandiant.com/ 

96  Type of Data Broad Range of Data – Product development & use – Manufacturing procedures – Business plans – Policy positions & white papers – Emails – User credentials & network architecture info 

97  Quantity of Data Difficult to determine – They clean up as they go (deleting archives) – Time lapse between theft and investigation In one observed case, APT1 stole approx 6.5 TB of compressed data from a single organization over a 10 month period 

98  Data Use and AKA’s Perceived Data Use In 2008 APT1 compromised the network of a company Tools were installed which enabled archive creation and access to emails Maintained active access for 2 ½ years During this time, China was able to negotiate a double- digit decrease in price per unit with the victim APT1 AKA Comment Crew (confirmed) Comment Group (confirmed) Shady Rat (possible) 

99  APT1 Attack Lifecycle & Other Groups APT1 Attack Lifecycle Initial compromise – usually Spear Phishing Install a backdoor Escalate privileges Explore the compromised network Expand the foothold Obtain legitimate credentials Collect and steal data APT1 – Not the only player Other Chinese (?) Groups Nitro Attacks Elderwood Sykipot Aurora Night Dragon 

100  China’s Blue Army On May 25, 2011, China’s PLA spokesperson Geng Yansheng announced the existence of a cybersecurity group. The group was referred to as an “Online Blue Army” and is based in China’s southern Guangzhou military region (Beech, 2011). At the time of the announcement, the blue army was comprised of 30 cybersecurity experts ranging from existing PLA soldiers, officers, college students and other various members of society (Lewis, 2011). It is believed that the Blue Army has been in existence for two years prior to the announcement. There are mixed reports on the financing available, ranging from just short of $1.5 million USD to over $10 million USD (Beech, 2011). 

101  Social Implications of Cyber Waning support for Communist agenda Growing interest in materialism Growing critical analysis and cognitive sophistication among Chinese non academia Protests and public unrest 

102  Governing Manifestations due to Cyber Reduced internet censorship to retain public support for agenda Required or strongly suggested educational direction in cyber and computer engineering Massive necessity for cyber defense force Must face environmental and human rights problems apparent via Internet 

103  Cyber Judgments Significant cyber espionage and attacks coming from China Strong evidence of government support or active participation in these activities Strong alignment between China’s self interest and the results of industrial cyber espionage Absence of provable attribution or consequences, activity likely to continue 

104  Countermeasure Recommendations Mandated level of security training in hardware & software for government, SCADA, and ICS network personnel Mandated level of security for hardware and software versions/configurations in government, SCADA, and ICS networks Required oversight/audits/pen testing of government, SCADA, and ICS networks Firm outline on what constitutes as a critical infrastructure (CI) network Incentive for cybersecurity service in government, SCADA, and ICS networks Intensive research and development for cyber offensive and defensive strategies Constructs must be asymmetric and coordinated
